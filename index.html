      ONE day, the cook went into the kitchen to make some gingerbread.
      She took some flour and water, and treacle and ginger, and mixed them all well together,
      and she put in some more water to make it thin, and then some more flour to make it thick,
      and a little salt and some spice, and then she rolled it out into a beautiful, smooth, dark-yellow dough.

      The Gingerbread Man Cook Makes Then she took the square tins and cut out some square cakes for the little boys, and with some round tins she cut out some round cakes for the little girls, and then she said, “I’m going to make a little gingerbread
      man for little Bobby.” So she took a nice round lump of dough for his body, and a smaller lump for his head, which she pulled out a little for the neck. Two other lumps were stuck on beneath for the legs, and were pulled out into proper shape,
      with feet and toes all complete, and two still smaller pieces were made into arms, with dear little hands and fingers.

      But the nicest work was done on the head, for the top was frizzed up into a pretty sugary hat; on either side was made a dear little ear, and in front, after the nose had been carefully moulded, a beautiful mouth was made out of a big raisin, and
      two bright little eyes with burnt almonds and caraway seeds.
